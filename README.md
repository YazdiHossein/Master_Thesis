Markowitz’s Model in the Formation of an Efficient Portfolio in the German Capital Market


Fundamentally, it is impossible to forecast the behavior of humans’ decisions about stock 
exchange markets. Numerous studies have been conducted that connect historical information 
to investors' rational judgments. In this research, the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Model is 
going to be tested in the German market by diversification in uncorrelated assets as much as 
possible, meaning it is about to test the practicality of the MPT1 in the German stock exchange 
market and offers it to investors to rely on. Based on the various names for the model in scientific 
studies, throughout this text, MPT or mean-variance will be the same as the Markowitz model.

Regarding the background, some publications provided a thorough analysis that is either relevant 
to or directly applies to the Markowitz Model. While others evaluated the model's applicability, 
comparability, resemblance, or modified it.

This is an applied, quantitative, and longitudinal research. From the data viewpoint, it uses
external, measurable, observable, and factual data. Its mathematical tools are the rate of return, 
standard deviation, correlation coefficient, variance, covariance, beta coefficient, and linear 
regression, using an Excel data Tool pack to analyze the data which is collected from the Yahoo 
Finance database. The CAPM and Linear Regression are the mathematical and statistical methods 
to establish the project. Regarding the design, it is objectively focused, neutral, and independent. 
Also, it has a positivist philosophy and real ontology.
